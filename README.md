# sales-data-analysis

This project is part of my learning journey in data analysis, where I explored a structured dataset containing sales transactions across various regions, product categories, and time periods.

The main objective of this analysis is to uncover meaningful business insights such as:

    Which region performs the best in terms of sales?

    Which product category drives the most revenue?

    How do monthly and yearly sales trends behave?

    When are profits highest, and what patterns can be observed?

To accomplish this, I used Microsoft Excel 2007 to clean, organize, and visualize the data through PivotTables, charts, and formulas.
