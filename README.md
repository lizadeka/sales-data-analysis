# sales-data-analysis

This project is part of my learning journey in data analysis, where I explored a structured dataset containing sales transactions across various regions, product categories, and time periods.

The main objective of this analysis is to uncover meaningful business insights such as:

    Which region performs the best in terms of sales?

    Which product category drives the most revenue?

    How do monthly and yearly sales trends behave?

    When are profits highest, and what patterns can be observed?

To accomplish this, I used Microsoft Excel 2007 to clean, organize, and visualize the data through PivotTables, charts, and formulas.

üßπ Data Cleaning: Issues Faced & Fixes

While preparing the dataset in Excel 2007, I encountered a few tricky data formatting challenges ‚Äî especially with the Order Date column. Here's how I tackled them:

1. ‚ùå Date Formatting Errors

Problem:The Order Date column looked fine visually, but formulas like =TEXT(..., "mmm") and =MONTH(...) returned #VALUE! errors.

Cause:Many of the dates were actually stored as text, not as real Excel date values.

Fix:

Used Excel's "Text to Columns" tool

Selected Delimited ‚Üí Next ‚Üí Next ‚Üí Column Data Format: Date (DMY)

The moment I converted to DMY, the dates automatically adjusted to valid date format ‚Äî no need for TRIM() or additional cleanup.

2. ‚úÖ Structured Reference Formula Saved the Day

Problem:Even after converting the dates, regular formulas still behaved inconsistently.

Solution:Using a structured reference formula inside a table:

=TEXT(Table3[[#This Row],[Order Date]],"mmm")

This worked perfectly and extracted the month name reliably. Structured references inside Excel tables forced Excel to treat the column as proper date values.

‚úÖ Final Checks

Used =ISNUMBER(...) to confirm all cells returned TRUE

Month names were extracted properly using TEXT(...)

Dataset was ready for pivot tables and further analysis

üí° Key Takeaway

In Excel 2007, even well-formatted-looking columns may store data as text. The "Text to Columns" tool with DMY conversion was the real game changer. Structured references further ensured stability across formulas.
